            <div>Our mission is to create a welcoming virtual third-space for anyone with an idea. Our goal is to foster community, provide resources, and support your ideas from start to finish.</div>
            <div>Through workshops, socials, and structured [programs], our focus is on artmaking as a communal practice. In a world continuously pushing us to monetize our art, and squishing that art into “content,” FLOAT AND FRIENDS aims to remind us that art can be done for art’s sake, and creativity is in our very human nature. At the same time, we provide workshops, guides, speaker nights, portfolio building opportunities, and other resources to help reveal often hidden steps for those who are interested in a creative career. </div>
